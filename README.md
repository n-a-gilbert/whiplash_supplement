# whiplash_supplement
Supplemental data &amp; code for deer behavior/winter whiplash project
NOTE: Using NIMBLE
These models are written in NIMBLE, a language derived from BUGS. Unlike previous programs (WinBUGS, JAGS), NIMBLE models are programmable objects in R, but are compiled in C++ for speed. Therefore, prior to installing NIMBLE, you must have Rtools installed so the code can be compiled. Please see the NIMBLE website for instructions.
